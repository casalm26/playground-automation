## Priority Order for MVP

### ðŸš€ Must Have (MVP)
1. Working Docker deployment
2. OpenAI content generation
3. One social platform integration (LinkedIn or Facebook)
4. Basic n8n workflow for posting
5. Simple approval mechanism
6. Health monitoring

### ðŸŽ¯ Should Have (V1)
1. Multiple platform support
2. Scheduled posting
3. Basic analytics
4. Ad campaign creation
5. A/B testing
6. API documentation

### ðŸ’¡ Nice to Have (V2+)
1. Advanced analytics dashboard
2. Image generation
3. Multi-language support
4. Competitor analysis
5. Performance prediction
6. Full UI dashboard

## Quick Start Checklist

### Day 1
- [ ] Set up server and DNS
- [ ] Deploy Docker stack
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Verify all services are running

### Week 1
- [ ] Implement OpenAI integration
- [ ] Create first n8n workflow
- [ ] Test content generation
- [ ] Add one platform integration

### Month 1
- [ ] Full platform integrations
- [ ] Analytics implementation
- [ ] Production monitoring
- [ ] Initial testing suite

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- All services maintain 99.9% uptime
- API response time < 500ms
- Successful TLS/HTTPS on all endpoints
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business
- Reduce content creation time by 80%
- Increase posting frequency by 5x
- Improve engagement rates by 30%
- Achieve positive ROI within 3 months

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement queuing and retry logic
- **Service Failures**: Add circuit breakers and fallbacks
- **Data Loss**: Regular automated backups
- **Security Breach**: Regular updates and security audits

### Business Risks
- **Platform API Changes**: Abstract integrations, monitor changelogs
- **Content Quality**: Human review step, quality scoring
- **Compliance**: Implement content filtering, follow platform rules
- **Cost Overruns**: Monitor API usage, implement limits

## Resource Requirements

### Infrastructure
- 1x Server (4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended)
- Domain with DNS control
- SSL certificates (handled by Caddy)

### API Keys Required
- OpenAI API key
- Meta Developer Account
- LinkedIn Developer Account
- Google Cloud Account (for Ads API)
- Slack Webhook (for notifications)

### Monthly Costs Estimate
- Server: $20-40 (DigitalOcean/Linode)
- OpenAI API: $50-200 (based on usage)
- Domain: $1-2
- Total: ~$75-250/month

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Today**: Review this roadmap and adjust priorities
2. **Tomorrow**: Set up server and deploy base stack
3. **This Week**: Implement OpenAI integration and first workflow
4. **Next Week**: Add first platform integration and test end-to-end
5. **This Month**: Achieve MVP with one fully working pipeline

## Notes

- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Test each integration thoroughly before moving on
- Keep security in mind from the beginning
- Document as you build
- Monitor costs closely, especially API usage
- Get user feedback early and often
